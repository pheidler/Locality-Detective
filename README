Makefile - Makes MatrixMult and executes program.
	usage: 
		make		makes MatrixMult
		make clean	removes binaries

MatrixMult.c - Initializes matrices A and B with random values. Matrices A, B, and C are all 1024x1024 matrices. Computes C = A*B three ways: (1) using matmult(A,B) which uses the naive matrix multiplication method, (2) using matmultTranspose(A,transpose(B)) which uses A and the transpose of B to calculate A*B and store it in D, utilizing spatial locality, (3) using matmultTile(A,B,b) which uses tiling to break A and B into bxb tiles (or sub matrices) and multiplies the results iteratively to store A*B in D, utilizing temporal locality. 
	output:
		execution time of matmult(A,B)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,1)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,2)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,4)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,8)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,16)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,32)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,64)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,128)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,256)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,512)
		execution time of matmultTile(A,B,1024)
		execution time of matmultTranspose(A,transpose(B))
